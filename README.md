Python - basic tic-tac-toe game on the command line

This was something I wanted to code in order to keep my programming muscles toned. I
was considering creating a GUI and possibly even an AI for the game, but at the moment
I will keep it as is. Perhaps once I learn a bit more about AI or have the time to teach
myself.
